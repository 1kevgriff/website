Hi ! I'm Jenni, nice to meet you. I'm a long-time gamer who has a passion for learning 3d modeling for graphic designs and game art, and Unity to make games. I started my Youtube channel back in 2012, and when I discovered Twitch a year later I hopped on board. It wasn't until January 2017 when I was streaming regularly, and continue to stream several times / week. Usually I'll be streaming in the Creative or Science & Tech sections but I make sure to take time to play really aweosme games that come out, as well as indie games, which I like to feature on Youtube as well.

When I'm not gaming, or building my digital art skills, I'm playing wiht my cat (15 yrs old) or making dank food, or hula hooping in the living room. I also have a t-shirt shredding hobby and a seperate channel for that. :-D
