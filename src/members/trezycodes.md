I'm a software engineer and a wannabe cyborg. I was born in the flatlands of Texas, raised among the luscious forests of the Shawnee National Forest, and I eventually found my way to the rolling hills of Wisconsin. My mother bought me my first technology book, [CliffsNotes: Creating Web Pages with HTML][CliffsNotes Book], when I was 12 and I used it to build my very first website: a Pokémon-themed choose-your-own-adventure. I've been writing code ever since. Thanks, [mom][Mom]. ❤️

My web dev hobby quickly became a full-time career. I've worked on tons of FOSS that's used by hundreds of thousands of projects all over the world, and fortunate enough to work with world-renowned brands like [Amazon][Amazon], [Disney][Disney], [Eventbrite][Eventbrite], [Getty Images][Getty], and [GoPro][GoPro].

These days I'm a full-stack engineer, a serial [open source contributor][Trezy on Github], and a regular [live streamer][TrezyCodes on Twitch]. I stream as I make games, websites, apps, and all sorts of other nifty stuff. A couple of projects I'm working on right now include:

### Floof-a-Doodle

### A Monster's Nature

*A Monster's Nature* is about a world inhabited by the intelligent ancestries (humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, birdfolk (tbd), catfolk (tbd), et al), who fight alongside their tamed companions to defeat the evils that inhabit their planet.
