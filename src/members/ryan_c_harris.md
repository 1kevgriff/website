Hey there! I'm a frontend developer based in Philly. I currently work at [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) and co-organize [Reactadelphia](https://www.meetup.com/Reactadelphia/). I'm passionate about technology and helping others learn. When I'm not streaming, I'm writing articles for my [website](https://ryanharris.dev) or busy wrestling my dog [Banjo](https://www.instagram.com/brewerytownbanjo/).
