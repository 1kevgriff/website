# About

Hi, I'm Sorskoot. I love coding ( mainly JavaScript or C#) and create awesome things. I can't stop talking about it and inspiring others.

On the streams we write code and work on modern web applications using WebXR, Web Audio and more.

### Personal Bio

![sorskoot](https://panels-images.twitch.tv/panel-77504814-image-030be827-6e68-4887-8465-646ff5035fe7)  
I've been developing software for over 25 years. I started around age 12 and never stopped. The last years I've been working as a lead developer on various web applications and mobile apps. In my free time I've been building games, audio tools, VR/AR and random utils mostly with JavaScript. In the past I worked as a 3D artist and as a developer at various organisations. I often develop in Visual Studio (Code) and Unity3D, but I know my way around graphic tools as well. I run a local meetup around WebXR in the Netherlands. And I've been awarded Microsoft MVP.

**_Sorskoot_**

The name Sorskoot was a nickname given by some fellow coders many years ago. When pronounced in Dutch it sounds similar to _source code_.
