LuckyNoSe7vin a.k.a Andy Morrell has been a developer since a young age, and professionally for the last 16 years. After his uncle (a developer) turned up in a TVR Griffith at 8 years old, the same year he got a ZX Spectrum for Christmas, that was almost a career choice made. When Andy finished formal education he went on to use the Microsoft .Net stack during the majority of his career. In recent years has developed skills in Cloud Architecture and building software in cloud service providers, such as AWS and Azure. Andy was recently given a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) Award in Developer Technologies for 2020/21, in recognition for his work in the development community.
