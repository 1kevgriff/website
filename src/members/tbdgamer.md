My name is Terry, I love software development. More importantly, I love getting better at software development. I've been a developer for 20 years, and my stream focus is on using that knowledge and experience and accepting that I don't know a whole load of stuff.

I pick up new to me technologies, I discuss my opinions and thoughts on building software, building teams and growing on our software development journey. I've yet to find the one project that will truly grab my attention, so each stream can be a different application, a different problem.
