Hey, I'm Benjamin. I'm a software developer in Upstate NY that focuses in on automations and data vizualization. Data is becoming the world's currency and if you can be able to understand it and digest it into a format that can be easily consumed is a key tool. With that, being able to build workflows to take data from various locations and automatically consume it in different platforms allows for more exposure and opportunities to find insights about things you or your company care about.

My stream encompases these topics including building avenues for viewing datasets that I am creating out of data that exists but isn't being captured into the right channels. As well you will see the development of flows and tools that allow scheduled tasks and actions to act and take manual processes of collecting / presenting data into ones without the need for human intervention.
